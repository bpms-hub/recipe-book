## Ingredients

| Ingredient         | ½ Batch | 1 Batch |
|--------------------|--------:|--------:|
| Bread Flour        |   250g  |   500g  |
| Whole Wheat Flour  |    50g  |   100g  |
| Water              |   200g  |   400g  |
| Sourdough Starter (100% hydration) |  50g  |   100g  |
| Salt               |     6g  |    12g  |

## Mixing

1. In a large bowl, combine bread flour, whole wheat flour, and water. Mix until just combined. Cover and let rest (autolyse) for 30–45 minutes.
2. Add sourdough starter and salt. Mix by hand until fully incorporated.
3. Perform a series of stretch and folds every 30 minutes for 2 hours, keeping the dough covered between folds.

## Bulk Fermentation

1. Let dough rise at room temperature (21–24°C/70–75°F) until nearly doubled, about 4–5 hours total (including folding time).

## Shaping

1. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Pre-shape into a round, cover, and rest 20 minutes.
2. Shape into a tight round or oval loaf. Place seam-side up in a floured proofing basket.

## Final Proof

1. Cover and proof at room temperature for 1–2 hours, or refrigerate overnight for improved flavor and scoring.

## Baking

1. Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C) with a Dutch oven or baking stone inside.
2. Turn loaf onto parchment, score the top with a sharp blade.
3. Transfer to the hot Dutch oven, cover, and bake 20 minutes with lid on.
4. Remove lid, reduce temperature to 450°F (230°C), and bake 20–25 minutes more until deep golden brown.
5. Cool completely on a rack before slicing or packaging.
