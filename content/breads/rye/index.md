## Mixing

1. In a large bowl, combine bread flour, rye flour, and salt.
2. Add water, sourdough starter, and molasses (if using). Mix until a sticky dough forms.
3. Knead by hand or with a mixer until dough is elastic and slightly tacky (about 5–7 minutes).
4. Mix in caraway seeds if desired.
5. Cover and let rise at room temperature until doubled (about 2–3 hours, or overnight in the fridge for more flavor).

## Shaping

1. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.
2. Shape into a round or oblong loaf, or place in a greased loaf pan.
3. Cover and let rise until puffy and nearly doubled (about 1 hour).

## Baking

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Place a pan of water in the oven for steam.
2. Score the top of the loaf with a sharp blade.
3. Bake for 30–35 minutes, until deep brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.
4. Cool completely on a rack before slicing or packaging.
