## Ingredients

| Ingredient         | ½ Batch | 1 Batch |
|--------------------|--------:|--------:|
| Bread Flour        |   250g  |   500g  |
| Eggs               |   110g  |   220g  |
| Whole Milk         |    30g  |    60g  |
| Sugar              |    35g  |    70g  |
| Salt               |     5g  |    10g  |

## Mixing

1. In a stand mixer bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast.
2. Add eggs and milk. Mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and elastic (about 8–10 minutes).
4. Gradually add the softened butter in small pieces, mixing until fully incorporated and dough is shiny and smooth.
5. Cover bowl and let dough rise at room temperature until doubled (about 1–2 hours).
6. Punch down dough, cover, and refrigerate overnight (or at least 4 hours) for easier shaping.

## Shaping

1. Turn chilled dough onto a lightly floured surface.
2. For a classic loaf: Divide dough as needed, shape into a log, and place in a greased loaf pan.
3. For individual brioche à tête: Divide into small balls, place in greased brioche molds, and pinch a small piece off each to form the “head.”
4. Cover and let rise until doubled and puffy (about 1–2 hours at room temperature).

## Baking

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Brush tops with egg wash (1 egg beaten with a splash of milk).
3. Bake loaves for 30–35 minutes, or small brioche for 18–22 minutes, until deep golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.
4. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then unmold and cool completely on a rack before slicing or packaging.
