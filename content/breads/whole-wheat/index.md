## Ingredients

| Ingredient         | ½ Batch | 1 Batch |
|--------------------|--------:|--------:|
| Whole Wheat Flour  |   250g  |   500g  |
| Bread Flour        |   100g  |   200g  |
| Water              |   230g  |   460g  |
| Honey (or sugar)   |    20g  |    40g  |
| Olive Oil (or butter) |  15g |    30g  |

## Mixing

1. In a large bowl, combine whole wheat flour, bread flour, salt, and yeast.
2. Add water, honey, and olive oil. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Knead by hand or with a mixer until smooth and elastic (about 8–10 minutes). Dough will be slightly tacky.

## Bulk Fermentation

1. Cover and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1–1.5 hours.

## Shaping

1. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.
2. Shape into a loaf or rolls as desired. Place in a greased loaf pan or on a baking sheet.
3. Cover and let rise until puffy and nearly doubled, about 45–60 minutes.

## Baking

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Bake loaf for 30–35 minutes, or rolls for 18–22 minutes, until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.
3. Cool on a rack before slicing or packaging.
