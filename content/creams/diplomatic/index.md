### Method

1. **Bloom gelatin**, strain, and reserve.
2. Heat **500g pastry cream** with **50g additional cream**.
3. Add gelatin, heat to 160°F to dissolve, blend with hand blender.
4. Pass through chinois into the remaining pastry cream.
5. Blend everything with hand blender until smooth. Temp should be at 120°F at time of pouring into cream.
6. Mix cream, sugar, salt, and vanilla in mixer on medium-high setting (2) until medium stiff peaks.
7. Slowly stream in 120°F temp pastry cream. Fold until glossy and peaks hold. Refrigerate.
8. Re-whip before use to bring back gloss.
9. Whip longer to achieve stronger hold, but be careful not to overwhip or it holds too many air pockets and doesn't have the same glossy and smooth mouthfeel.
