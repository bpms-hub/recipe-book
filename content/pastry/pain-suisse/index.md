### Dough Preparation

1. Combine flour, milk, water, sugar, salt, yeast, and dough butter in a mixer.
2. Mix on low speed until a smooth, slightly tacky dough forms (about 3–5 minutes).
3. Wrap dough and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

### Lamination

1. Prepare butter block and lock into dough as for croissants.
2. Perform three single folds, resting and chilling between each fold.
3. After final fold, rest dough at least 1 hour before shaping.

### Shaping

1. Roll laminated dough to 4mm thickness.
2. Cut into rectangles (about 10x15cm).
3. Pipe or spread a line of pastry cream down the center of each rectangle.
4. Place chocolate batons or chopped chocolate over the pastry cream.
5. Fold one long side over the filling, then the other, overlapping slightly.
6. Place seam side down on a parchment-lined tray.

### Proofing & Baking

1. Proof at 24–26°C (75–78°F), 75–80% humidity, until doubled and puffy (about 2 hours).
2. Brush with egg wash.
3. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 15–18 minutes, until golden brown.
4. Cool on rack. Optionally, glaze with simple syrup for shine.

*Tips:*
- Keep dough and butter cold during lamination.
- Use well-chilled pastry cream to prevent melting during shaping.
- For extra flavor, sprinkle with pearl sugar before baking.
