### Ingredients

| Ingredient                | ½ Batch | 1 Batch |
|---------------------------|--------:|--------:|
| All-Purpose Flour         |   200g  |   400g  |
| Salt                      |     4g  |     8g  |
| Sugar (optional, for sweet pies) |  10g  |    20g  |
| Unsalted Butter (cold, cubed)    |  120g  |   240g  |
| Ice Water                 |    60g  |   120g  |

### Method

1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**  
   In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar (if using).

2. **Cut in Butter:**  
   Add cold, cubed butter. Using a pastry cutter or fingertips, work butter into flour until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces.

3. **Add Water:**  
   Drizzle in ice water, mixing gently with a fork until dough just comes together. Add a bit more water if needed, but do not overwork.

4. **Shape & Chill:**  
   Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Press and fold a few times to bring together.  
   Divide and shape into flat discs about 2–3 cm thick. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 2 days).

### Shaping

1. Remove dough from fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5–10 minutes if very firm.
2. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to about 3–4 mm thick, rotating often to prevent sticking.
3. Fit dough into pie pan, gently pressing into corners. Trim excess, leaving a 2cm overhang for crimping.
4. For a double crust, repeat with second disc. Fill pie, then lay top crust over, trim, and crimp edges as desired. Cut vents in top.

### Baking Procedure

- **Blind Baking (for pre-baked crusts):**  
  Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line crust with parchment and fill with pie weights. Bake 15–20 minutes, remove weights, and bake 5–10 minutes more until golden.

- **Filled Pies:**  
  Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Fill pie as desired. Bake 20 minutes at 400°F, then reduce to 350°F (175°C) and bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbling (usually 30–40 minutes more).

- **Tips:**  
  - Chill shaped pie in freezer for 10 minutes before baking for best flakiness.
  - Brush top crust with egg wash for shine, and sprinkle with sugar if desired.
