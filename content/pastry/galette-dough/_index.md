### Ingredients

| Ingredient         | ½ Batch | 1 Batch |
|--------------------|--------:|--------:|
| All-Purpose Flour  |   200g  |   400g  |
| Semolina Flour     |    50g  |   100g  |
| Salt               |     4g  |     8g  |
| Unsalted Butter (cold, cubed) |  125g  |   250g  |
| Buttermilk (cold)  |   100g  |   200g  |

### Method

1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**  
   In a large bowl, combine all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt.

2. **Cut in Butter:**  
   Add cold, cubed butter. Using a pastry cutter or fingertips, work butter into flour until pea-sized pieces remain.

3. **Add Buttermilk:**  
   Pour in cold buttermilk and gently mix just until dough comes together. Do not overwork.

4. **Shape & Mold:**  
   Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Press and fold a few times to bring together.  
   Divide and shape dough into square blocks, about 2–3 cm thick, sized to fit your RAM sheeter.

5. **Wrap & Refrigerate:**  
   Wrap each block tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight, to fully hydrate and chill.

6. **Sheeting:**  
   Remove dough from fridge. If very firm, let rest at room temperature for 5–10 minutes.  
   Dust with flour and pass through the RAM sheeter, starting at the thickest setting.  
   Gradually reduce thickness, dusting lightly as needed, until desired thickness is reached (typically 3–4 mm for galettes).

### Tips

- Keep all ingredients and dough cold to ensure flakiness.
- If dough cracks while sheeting, let it rest a few more minutes to relax.
- Excess dough can be rewrapped and chilled for later use.
