Chill until firm but pliable. Lock-In: Roll dough into a rectangle twice the size of the butter block. Place butter on one half, fold dough over, and seal edges. First Roll: Using the RAM sheeter, roll dough to 7mm thickness. Perform a single (letter) fold. Rest: Wrap and refrigerate for 30–45 minutes.

Using a pastry cutter or fingertips, work butter into flour until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces.\nAdd Water:\nDrizzle in ice water, mixing gently with a fork until dough just comes together. Add a bit more water if needed, but do not overwork.\nShape \u0026 Chill:\nTurn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Press and fold a few times to bring together.\nDivide and shape into flat discs about 2–3 cm thick. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 2 days).\nShaping Remove dough from fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5–10 minutes if very firm. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to about 3–4 mm thick, rotating often to prevent sticking. Fit dough into pie pan, gently pressing into corners. Trim excess, leaving a 2cm overhang for crimping. For a double crust, repeat with second disc. Fill pie, then lay top crust over, trim, and crimp edges as desired. Cut vents in top. Baking Procedure Blind Baking (for pre-baked crusts):\nPreheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line crust with parchment and fill with pie weights. Bake 15–20 minutes, remove weights, and bake 5–10 minutes more until golden.\nFilled Pies:\nPreheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Fill pie as desired.
