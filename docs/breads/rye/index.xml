    <description>Ingredients Ingredient ½ Batch 1 Batch Bread Flour 200g 400g Rye Flour 150g 300g Water 200g 400g Sourdough Starter (100% hydration) 75g 150g Salt 7g 14g Caraway Seeds (opt.) 3g 6g Molasses (opt.) 10g 20g Instant Yeast (if not using only starter) 2g 4g Mixing In a large bowl, combine bread flour, rye flour, and salt. Add water, sourdough starter, and molasses (if using). Mix until a sticky dough forms. Knead by hand or with a mixer until dough is elastic and slightly tacky (about 5–7 minutes). Mix in caraway seeds if desired. Cover and let rise at room temperature until doubled (about 2–3 hours, or overnight in the fridge for more flavor). Shaping Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Shape into a round or oblong loaf, or place in a greased loaf pan. Cover and let rise until puffy and nearly doubled (about 1 hour). Baking Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Place a pan of water in the oven for steam. Score the top of the loaf with a sharp blade. Bake for 30–35 minutes, until deep brown and hollow-sounding when tapped. Cool completely on a rack before slicing or packaging.</description>
