    <description>Ingredients Ingredient ½ Batch 1 Batch Mango Puree 150g 300g Sugar 60g 120g Egg Yolks 40g 80g Whole Eggs 30g 60g Lemon Juice 10g 20g Unsalted Butter 60g 120g Salt pinch pinch Method In a saucepan, whisk together mango puree, sugar, egg yolks, whole eggs, lemon juice, and salt until smooth. Place the saucepan on an induction burner set to medium-low heat. Cook the mixture, stirring constantly with a heatproof spatula, making sure to scrape the sides and bottom. Heat gently until the curd thickens and reaches 82–84°C (180–183°F). Do not let it boil. Remove from heat and immediately whisk in the cold butter until fully emulsified and smooth. Strain the curd through a fine mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any cooked egg bits. Pouring Technique While the curd is still warm and fluid, carefully pour or ladle it into pre-baked tart shells. Tap the tart shells gently on the counter to level the curd and release any air bubbles. Allow the filled tarts to cool at room temperature for 10–15 minutes, then refrigerate until fully set (at least 2 hours). Garnish as desired before serving. Tip: For a glossy finish, cover the surface of the curd with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming while cooling.</description>
