<li>Place the saucepan on an induction burner set to medium-low heat.</li>
<li>Cook the mixture, stirring constantly with a heatproof spatula, making sure to scrape the sides and bottom.</li>
<li>Heat gently until the curd thickens and reaches 82–84°C (180–183°F). Do not let it boil.</li>
<li>Remove from heat and immediately whisk in the cold butter until fully emulsified and smooth.</li>
<li>Strain the curd through a fine mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any cooked egg bits.</li>

<h3 id="pouring-technique">Pouring Technique</h3>
<ol>
<li>While the curd is still warm and fluid, carefully pour or ladle it into pre-baked tart shells.</li>
<li>Tap the tart shells gently on the counter to level the curd and release any air bubbles.</li>
<li>Allow the filled tarts to cool at room temperature for 10–15 minutes, then refrigerate until fully set (at least 2 hours).</li>
<li>Garnish as desired before serving.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tip: For a glossy finish, cover the surface of the curd with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming while cooling.</em></p>

<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong><br>
In a large bowl, combine all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cut in Butter:</strong><br>
Add cold, cubed butter. Using a pastry cutter or fingertips, work butter into flour until pea-sized pieces remain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add Buttermilk:</strong><br>
Pour in cold buttermilk and gently mix just until dough comes together. Do not overwork.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shape &amp; Mold:</strong><br>
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Press and fold a few times to bring together.<br>
Divide and shape dough into square blocks, about 2–3 cm thick, sized to fit your RAM sheeter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wrap &amp; Refrigerate:</strong><br>
Wrap each block tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight, to fully hydrate and chill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sheeting:</strong><br>
Remove dough from fridge. If very firm, let rest at room temperature for 5–10 minutes.<br>
Dust with flour and pass through the RAM sheeter, starting at the thickest setting.<br>
Gradually reduce thickness, dusting lightly as needed, until desired thickness is reached (typically 3–4 mm for galettes).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep all ingredients and dough cold to ensure flakiness.</li>
<li>If dough cracks while sheeting, let it rest a few more minutes to relax.</li>
<li>Excess dough can be rewrapped and chilled for later use.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Combine flour, milk, water, sugar, salt, yeast, and dough butter in a mixer.</li>
<li>Mix on low speed until a smooth, slightly tacky dough forms (about 3–5 minutes).</li>
<li>Do not overmix; gluten should be developed but not tight.</li>
<li>Wrap dough and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lamination-ram-sheeter">Lamination (RAM Sheeter)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prepare Butter Block:</strong> Shape lamination butter into a flat, even rectangle (about 1cm thick). Chill until firm but pliable.</li>
<li><strong>Lock-In:</strong> Roll dough into a rectangle twice the size of the butter block. Place butter on one half, fold dough over, and seal edges.</li>
<li><strong>First Roll:</strong> Using the RAM sheeter, roll dough to 7mm thickness. Perform a single (letter) fold.</li>
<li><strong>Rest:</strong> Wrap and refrigerate for 30–45 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Second Roll:</strong> Roll to 7mm again, perform another single fold. Rest as above.</li>
<li><strong>Third Roll:</strong> Roll to 7mm, perform a final single fold. Rest at least 1 hour before shaping.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="shaping">Shaping</h3>
<ol>
<li>Roll laminated dough to 4mm thickness using the RAM sheeter.</li>
<li>Trim edges for clean layers. Cut triangles (base about 8cm, height about 20cm).</li>
<li>Gently stretch each triangle, then roll up from base to tip, keeping tension but not compressing layers.</li>
<li>Place croissants on parchment-lined trays, tip side down.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="proofing--refrigeration">Proofing &amp; Refrigeration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Proof at 24–26°C (75–78°F), 75–80% humidity, until doubled and very jiggly (about 2–3 hours).</li>
<li>For best flavor and convenience, you can retard shaped croissants in the fridge overnight after partial proof (about 1 hour at room temp, then refrigerate).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="baking">Baking</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C) with convection, or 425°F (220°C) without.</li>
<li>Brush croissants with egg wash (1 egg + pinch of salt).</li>
<li>Bake for 16–20 minutes, rotating halfway, until deep golden brown and crisp.</li>
<li>Cool on rack before serving.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tips:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep dough and butter cold throughout lamination.</li>
<li>If dough resists rolling or butter softens, chill between steps.</li>
<li>For extra shine, apply a second egg wash halfway through baking.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong><br>
In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar (if using).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cut in Butter:</strong><br>
Add cold, cubed butter. Using a pastry cutter or fingertips, work butter into flour until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add Water:</strong><br>
Drizzle in ice water, mixing gently with a fork until dough just comes together. Add a bit more water if needed, but do not overwork.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shape &amp; Chill:</strong><br>
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Press and fold a few times to bring together.<br>
Divide and shape into flat discs about 2–3 cm thick. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 2 days).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="shaping">Shaping</h3>
<ol>
<li>Remove dough from fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5–10 minutes if very firm.</li>
<li>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to about 3–4 mm thick, rotating often to prevent sticking.</li>
<li>Fit dough into pie pan, gently pressing into corners. Trim excess, leaving a 2cm overhang for crimping.</li>
<li>For a double crust, repeat with second disc. Fill pie, then lay top crust over, trim, and crimp edges as desired. Cut vents in top.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="baking-procedure">Baking Procedure</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Blind Baking (for pre-baked crusts):</strong><br>
Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line crust with parchment and fill with pie weights. Bake 15–20 minutes, remove weights, and bake 5–10 minutes more until golden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Filled Pies:</strong><br>
Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Fill pie as desired. Bake 20 minutes at 400°F, then reduce to 350°F (175°C) and bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbling (usually 30–40 minutes more).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chill shaped pie in freezer for 10 minutes before baking for best flakiness.</li>
<li>Brush top crust with egg wash for shine, and sprinkle with sugar if desired.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
